# AI-Powered Face Recognition Door Lock System

## Overview

This project implements an advanced, AI-powered face recognition door lock system using a Raspberry Pi, servo motors, and a camera. The system employs deep learning techniques to accurately identify authorized individuals and control access, offering a high-tech, hands-free security solution for homes or offices.

## Key Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Exceptional accuracy (99.7% on test set)
- Servo motor control for physical lock mechanism
- Optimized for resource-constrained devices (Raspberry Pi)
- Scalable to multiple users

## Technical Stack

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, Servo Motor, Camera Module
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Framework**: TensorFlow (converted to TensorFlow Lite)
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **GPIO Control**: RPi.GPIO

## Machine Learning Model

Our custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieves an impressive 99.7% accuracy on the test set. The model architecture includes:

- Two convolutional layers with max pooling
- Flatten layer
- Two dense layers with ReLU activation
- Softmax output layer for multi-class classification

## Challenges and Solutions

### Memory Constraints

**Challenge**: The Raspberry Pi's limited RAM was insufficient to run the full TensorFlow model.

**Solution**: We optimized the model and converted it to TensorFlow Lite, significantly reducing the memory footprint while maintaining high accuracy.

### Real-time Performance

**Challenge**: Achieving real-time face detection and recognition on a resource-constrained device.

**Solution**: Implemented efficient preprocessing techniques and leveraged OpenCV's Haar Cascade for rapid face detection, enabling smooth real-time performance.

### Hardware Integration

**Challenge**: Integrating the servo motor with the AI system for physical lock control.

**Solution**: Utilized RPi.GPIO for precise servo motor control, synchronizing it seamlessly with the face recognition results.

## Implementation Details

- The system uses a webcam to capture real-time video.
- Face detection is performed using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier.
- Detected faces are preprocessed and fed into the TensorFlow Lite model for recognition.
- The model classifies the face into predefined categories (e.g., "Skylar", "Johnny", "Tim").
- If an unauthorized face is detected, the system triggers the servo motor to lock the door.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with smart home systems
- Multi-factor authentication options
- Remote access and monitoring capabilities
- Edge AI optimizations for even faster inference

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the powerful combination of AI, computer vision, and embedded systems to create a practical, high-security solution. The ability to achieve 99.7% accuracy on a resource-constrained device showcases both the effectiveness of our streamlined machine learning model and our optimization techniques.
